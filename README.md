# Meeting Manager

[View the live app here.](http://flask-meeting-manager-project.herokuapp.com/)

## UX

### **Goals:**

The goal of the app is to provide a service to small businesses and non-profits which will enable them to plan, document and create actionable items from their board or staff meetings. 
It provides them with a set structure to enable the creation and storage of material such as agendas, meeting minutes, and action plans. The app requests that all users register 
and login to view the 'Meeting Manager' associated with their particular group. Once logged in the user can then create, read, update and delete their 'Meetings'. The app is optimized for use on phones and tablets.

### Defensive Design Testing

- As detailed above all features have been designed with the consideration to the session user to manage the user actions and visibility
- Navigation menu items have been restricted based on session user

### **Code Validators**

To ensure all code was clean, bug free and most importantly for python PEP8 compliant the following validators were used on the site: 

- [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate CSS code
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS code
- [JSlint](https://jslint.com) to validate jQuery Code
- Pylint to validate Python code

### **Site UI/UX & Browser Compatibility Testing**

- Manual testing was carried out on this site by the developers family members to review the UX and site responsivness
- Chrome dev tools were used to review responsivness on multiple devices:
    - Moto G4
    - Galaxy S5
    - Pixel 2/2 XL
    - iPhone 5/5E/6/7/8/8+/X
    - iPad/Pro
    - Surface Duo
    - Galaxy Fold
- Cross browser testing was also attempted on Chrome, Firefox and Safari

### Fixed Bugs

- Despite requesting that a user registers and logs in, any page was visible in the browser by copying and pasting the full web address.
- Fixed issue by implementing function which required the correct user or admin to have access to certain urls. This directs the incorrect user to an error page.


 ## DEPLOYMENT

This project was created using Github, from there I used Gitpod to write my code.
Then I used commits to git followed by pushes to my GitHub repository.
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used automated pushes to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku.
For deployment on Heroku I've used the following steps:
* Using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt I have created a requirements.txt file.
* Using the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile I have created a procfile.
* I've used git add, git commit and git push to push the requirements and procfile to GitHub.
* I've created a new app on the Heroku website by using the "new" button on my dashboard.
* I gave the app a name of flask-meeting-manager-project and set the region to Europe.
* From the Heroku dashboard I've clicked "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and selected GitHub.
* Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
* In the Heroku dashboard I've clicked "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
* I've added the config vars for my IP, PORT, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY.
* In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page I've made sure the master branch is selected and I've clicked "Deploy Branch".
* The site is now successfully deployed.
