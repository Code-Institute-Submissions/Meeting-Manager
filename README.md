# Meeting Manager



## UX

### **Goals:**

The goal of the app is to provide a service to small businesses and non-profits which will enable them to plan, document and create actionable items from their board or staff meetings. 
It provides them with a set structure to enable the creation and storage of material such as agendas, meeting minutes, and action plans. The app requests that all users register 
and login to view the 'Meeting Manager' associated with their particular group. Once logged in the user can then create, read, update and delete their 'Meetings'. The app is optimized for use on phones and tablets.

### Bugs


 ## DEPLOYMENT

This project was created using Github, from there I used Gitpod to write my code.
Then I used commits to git followed by pushes to my GitHub repository.
I've deployed this project to Heroku and used automated pushes to make sure my pushes to GitHub were also made to Heroku.
For deployment on Heroku I've used the following steps:
* Using the terminal command pip freeze > requirements.txt I have created a requirements.txt file.
* Using the terminal command echo web: python app.py > Procfile I have created a procfile.
* I've used git add, git commit and git push to push the requirements and procfile to GitHub.
* I've created a new app on the Heroku website by using the "new" button on my dashboard.
* I gave the app a name of flask-meeting-manager-project and set the region to Europe.
* From the Heroku dashboard I've clicked "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and selected GitHub.
* Confirm the linking of the Heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.
* In the Heroku dashboard I've clicked "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".
* I've added the config vars for my IP, PORT, MONGO_URI and SECRET_KEY.
* In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page I've made sure the master branch is selected and I've clicked "Deploy Branch".
* The site was now successfully deployed.
