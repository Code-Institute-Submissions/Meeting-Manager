# Meeting Manager



## UX

### **Goals:**

The goal of the app is to provide a service to small businesses and non-profits which will enable them to plan, document and create actionable items from their board or staff meetings. 
It provides them with a set structure to enable the creation and storage of material such as agendas, meeting minutes, and action plans. The app requests that all users register 
and login to view the 'Meeting Manager' associated with their particular group. Once logged in the user can then create, read, update and delete their 'Meetings'. The app is optimized for use on phones and tablets.
